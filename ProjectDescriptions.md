Cryptography.py is a project a worked on during my 3rd semester where I coded a cryptographer that takes a given input and key and encrypts and decrypts it upon the user's request.
ImageProcessor.py is also a project I worked on during my 3rd semester where I made a program that takes a .bmp file and lets you make changes to the pixels on it.
