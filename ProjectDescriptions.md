# Perti-Projects
Cryptography.py is a project a worked on during my 3rd semester where I coded a cryptographer that takes a given input and key and encrypts and decrypts it upon the user's request.
ImageProcessor.py is also a project I worked on during my 3rd semester where I made a program that takes a .bmp file and lets you make changes to the pixels on it.
Genomics.py is a machine learning project I worked on during my 4th semester in my computational biology class. I learned to use sklearn, numpy, io, and other packages used in the field of computational biology to find genes in E. coli that could be of use to study anti-microbial resitance.
